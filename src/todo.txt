Feature requests/new features:
**********

- Write a developer guide to make programs more splay friendly: better explain which Lua features can be used, 
  how to circumvent the sandbox limitations for getenv, how to use the command-line tools to deploy jobs, how to configure sandbox restrictions

- in controller, check if the size of the actions table can be significantly reduce (why do we keep all splayd actions all the time?)

- add an option to the job creation panel / command to print or not print the header in the logs 
  (useful for demos and when one needs to visually process a log)

- Notification system. The controller could  notify the submitter once the job has finished. For now, email notification is enough. 

- integrate the text editor of http://repl.it/ in the SplayWeb page for job submission

- sockets should be provide finer grainer statistics. 
  In particular: 
  1) total bytes sent/received for TCP/UDP, 
  2) opening/closing time measurements to obtain a socket

- check files splayweb/app/model/user_observer|notifier as they might be legacy from a very faraway past

- pagination: in SplayWeb, the list of splayds/jobs should allow pagination, to show N results for each page.

- Write HOW_TO_BUILD.xml to explain how to build the various Splay packages.
